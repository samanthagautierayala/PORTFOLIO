							<h2>
								My Journey
							</h2>
							<p>Since I can remember, I've been fueled by creativity and a desire to explore the world around me. This innate curiosity led me to discover my two greatest passions: traveling and graphic design. From the enchanting streets of Paris to the serene landscapes of my hometown, Caracas, Venezuela, I've always found inspiration in the diversity of cultures and environments. Each journey has not only broadened my horizons but also enriched my perspective, influencing my approach to design and communication.

							</p>

							<h2>Graphic Design</h2>
							<p>In the realm of design, I feel most at home. Proficient in Adobe Creative Suite applications like Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign, I love bringing ideas to life through visual storytelling. Whether it's crafting captivating advertisements, designing eye-catching logos, or developing immersive brand experiences, I thrive on the endless possibilities that design offers. Through my coursework and personal projects, I've honed my skills and cultivated a keen eye for detail, always striving to push the boundaries of creativity.
								
							</p>

							<h2>Why advertising and public relations?</h2>
							<p>I'm drawn to the dynamic nature of advertising and public relations, where every campaign is an opportunity to make a meaningful impact. Whether it's sparking conversations, driving engagement, or shaping perceptions, I believe in the power of strategic communication to connect people and ideas. With a blend of creativity and strategic thinking, I aspire to craft campaigns that not only resonate with audiences but also drive real results for brands and causes that I'm passionate about.</p>
<br>
							<p>As a student, I'm constantly seeking new opportunities to learn, grow, and push the boundaries of my creativity. I'm excited to continue my journey at the University of Miami, where I can further develop my skills in creative advertising and public relations, while also exploring my passions for traveling and graphic design. I look forward to the challenges and experiences that lie ahead, and I'm eager to make a meaningful impact in the world of advertising and beyond.</p>
